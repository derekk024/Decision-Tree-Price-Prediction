Decision Tree Price Prediction

IMPORTANT NOTICE
As of now, yfinance has changed access to certain tickers, rendering the prediction-producing parts of this project deprecated and non-functional. The code will require modifications to work with updated data sources.
Additionally, TensorFlow experiments were conducted at my home in San Diego, and older files will be uploaded once I return for spring break.

Project Overview

This project explores decision tree-based models to predict when an index is likely to increase, leveraging market data from related indices. The methodology involves:
	•	Decision trees for classification and probability-based predictions
	•	Analysis of prediction overlap to refine forecasting accuracy (can only hold one index from open to close on a given day)
	•	Monte Carlo simulations for return estimation

Project Contents

Predicting Days of Price Increment
	•	Uses market data from the target index and relevant related indices
	•	Implements a decision tree classifier with model.predict_proba() and a threshold-based system
	•	Outputs predicted days where the index is likely to increase

Prediction Overlap for N Events
	•	Aggregates predictions from multiple models
	•	Measures how often predicted days overlap across models
	•	Helps adjust return estimations accordingly

Stochastic Return Estimation
	•	Uses Monte Carlo simulations to model year-over-year return distributions
	•	Simulates returns using:
	•	Empirical distributions of S&P 500 returns
	•	Theoretical distributions of predicted index returns

Important Results (CSV File)
	•	Contains results with significant price changes
	•	Key columns:
	•	Fourth-to-last column: Average price change (e.g., 0.11 = 11%)
	•	Second-to-last column: Standard deviation of price change

DT AI Transformed Data (CSV File)
	•	Comprehensive dataset of all decision tree predictions
	•	Includes descriptions of column mappings for reference

Future Updates
	•	Uploading older TensorFlow experiment files over spring break
	•	Exploring alternative data sources for yfinance-dependent code
