# Decision-Tree-Price-Prediction
This project uses decision trees to predict when the price of an index goes up based on related indices and market data. Unfortunately, yfinance has changed access to certain tickers, so the code included in the project is deprecated and is NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. 

This project includes a file of generating predictions, a file of calculating the average overlap of prediction days, and a file of predicting the average alpha and deviation of alpha.
